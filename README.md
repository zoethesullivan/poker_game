> Simple web-app Blackjack game written in JavaScript. This project is no longer maintained as of 2023.

The [Blackjack Application](elaborate-palmier-dc5f07.netlify.app/) generates random cards as requested by user. After user reaches "Blackjack" or 21, no more cards can be drawn.

Project completed as part of Scrimba's [Learn JavaScript for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) course.
